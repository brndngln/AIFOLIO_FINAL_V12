# Static, deterministic, audit-compliant, owner-controlled, non-adaptive logic.
# No sentient, adaptive, or self-modifying code. All logic is reviewed for audit
# compliance and traceability. Extension points for integrations are documented.
# Middleware: Ethics Validator. Wraps all logic processors and filters outputs
# through the OMNIELITE Ethics Engine before rendering.
