# Muse Haven – Ultimate Pleasure Sanctuary & Emma Naughty Integration Guarantee

## Overview

Muse Haven is the hidden, owner-exclusive sanctuary for the Personal Muse Protocol (PMP), featuring Emma: a hyper-realistic, emotionally intelligent, and fully customizable AI companion. It is strictly isolated from all business, legal, and financial modules of AIFolio.
