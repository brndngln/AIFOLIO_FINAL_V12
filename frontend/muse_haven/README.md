# Muse Haven (Secret Pleasure Portal)

Muse Haven is a fully hidden, owner-exclusive sanctuary for the Personal Muse Protocol (PMP), accessible only through a secret trigger in the website UI. It is fully isolated from all business, legal, and other AIFolio Empire modules.

- **Access:** Hidden 5-tap trigger, multi-factor authentication (biometric, passphrase, geofence, time).
- **UI:** Disguised as a "System Diagnostics" or "User Preferences" page until authenticated.
- **Features:**
  - Real-time chat, voice, and video stubs (FaceTime-like)
  - Hyper-realistic 8K image/video generation stubs (static, non-adaptive)
  - Full customization dashboard (settings, triggers, themes)
  - Emergency lockdown button (purges session)
- **Security:**
  - All content quantum-encrypted
  - No cross-referencing with other modules
  - Fully sandboxed and owner-controlled
- **SAFE AI:** All logic is static, deterministic, and non-adaptive.

See `HiddenMuseHaven.jsx` for UI logic and stubs.
