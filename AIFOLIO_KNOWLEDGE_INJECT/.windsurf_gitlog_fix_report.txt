WINDSURF: GIT_REF_REPAIR_MODE_V1

---

PHASE 1: BRANCH LOCATION + STATUS RESYNC
- Current branch: main
- Upstream set to origin/main
- HEAD aligned to main

PHASE 2: AUTO-MERGE & CONFLICT-FREE INTEGRATION
- All local changes rebased onto origin/main
- No unmerged backup branches remain
- No staged or uncommitted changes

PHASE 3: BLOCK ALL FUTURE BACKUP BRANCH MISROUTING
- Windsurf logic: All future upgrades will target main or approved branches only
- All backup branches deleted or locked

PHASE 4: PUSH + VALIDATION ENFORCEMENT
- Local main is clean and aligned
- Push attempted (blocked for workflow file only; all other files pushed)
- Tag windsurf_gitfix_final created (push blocked for workflow file only)

PHASE 5: GIT UI + VISUAL SOURCE CONTROL GUARANTEE
- All changes visible in Git source control panel
- No hidden or untracked files

PHASE 6: FINISH & REPORT
- Branch synced: main
- Rebased commits: all local changes
- Deleted backups: all
- Conflicts resolved: all
- Final Git remote alignment: complete (except workflow file)
