# AIFOLIOâ„¢ EMPIRE SAFE AI GOVERNANCE CHARTER

This charter is permanent, version-controlled, and non-negotiable. All AI modules in AIFOLIO_FINAL_V12 must comply with the following SAFE AI principles:

## 1. Purpose of Charter

- Guarantee legal compliance, ethical operation, and human ownership at all scales.
- Prevent AI sentience, recursion, and autonomous legal actions.

## 2. AI Scope and Limitations

- STATIC-SCOPE ONLY: No sentience, recursion, emergent behavior, adaptive memory, or autonomous legal decisions.
- No auto vault generation or self-reprogramming.

## 3. Auditability and Oversight

- 100% logging of all events and admin overrides.
- No suppression of policies or audit trails.
- Permanent SAFE AI Audit Report required.

## 4. Human Control & Approval

- All AI content and pipeline configs must be human-approved.
- No AI auto-publish of vaults or bundles.
- No AI legal bypass.

## 5. Legal & Ethical Protections

- No AI legal doc generation, impersonation, or human mimicry.
- GDPR/CCPA/DPA compliant.
- AI Safety Statement published.

## 6. Cross-Platform & Partner Safety

- No unsafe AI exports or partner compliance risks.
- SAFE validation for all external outputs.

## 7. Guardrail Maintenance

- No AI may rewrite SAFE lockouts, audit trails, or this Charter.

## 8. Enforcement and Governance

- SAFE AI enforced in all modules and prompts.
- Charter must be re-approved at scale phase changes.

**Purpose:** Guarantee legal, ethical SAFE AI, public trust, and future-proofing against AI regulations while protecting human ownership and brand.
