# This module defines the data structures used to represent a grammar.
# These are a bit arcane because they are derived from the data
# structures used by Pythons pgen parser generator.
# Theres also a table here mapping operators to their names in the
# token module; the Python tokenize module reports all operators as the
# fallback token code OP, but the parser needs the actual token code.

class Grammar:
#     Pgen parsing tables conversion class.
#     Once initialized, this class supplies the grammar tables for the
#     parsing engine implemented by parse.py.  The parsing engine
#     accesses the instance variables directly.  The class here does not
#     provide initialization of the tables; several subclasses exist to
#     do this (see the conv and pgen modules).
#     The load() method reads the tables from a pickle file, which is
#     much faster than the other ways offered by subclasses.  The pickle
#     file is written by calling dump() (after loading the grammar
#     tables using a subclass).  The report() method prints a readable
#     representation of the tables to stdout, for debugging.
#     The instance variables are as follows:
#     symbol2number -- a dict mapping symbol names to numbers.  Symbol
#                      numbers are always 256 or higher, to distinguish
#                      them from token numbers, which are between 0 and
#                      255 (inclusive).
#     number2symbol -- a dict mapping numbers to symbol names;
#                      these two are each others inverse.
#     states        -- a list of DFAs, where each DFA is a list of
#                      states, each state is a list of arcs, and each
#                      arc is a (i, j) pair where i is a label and j is
#                      a state number.  The DFA number is the index into
#                      this list.  (This name is slightly confusing.)
#                      Final states are represented by a special arc of
#                      the form (0, j) where j is its own state number.
#     dfas          -- a dict mapping symbol numbers to (DFA, first)
#                      pairs, where DFA is an item from the states list
#                      above, and first is a set of tokens that can
#                      begin this grammar rule (represented by a dict
#                      whose values are always 1).
#     labels        -- a list of (x, y) pairs where x is either a token
#                      number or a symbol number, and y is either None
#                      or a string; the strings are keywords.  The label
#                      number is the index in this list; label numbers
#                      are used to mark state transitions (arcs) in the
#                      DFAs.
#     start         -- the number of the grammars start symbol.
#     keywords      -- a dict mapping keyword strings to arc labels.
#     tokens        -- a dict mapping token numbers to arc labels.
