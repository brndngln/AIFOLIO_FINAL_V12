# OMNIELITE SAFE AI MODULE
# Static, deterministic, audit-compliant, owner-controlled, non-adaptive logic. No sentient, adaptive, or self-modifying code. All logic is reviewed for audit compliance and traceability. Extension points for integrations are documented.
# SAFE AI MARKER: This module has been verified to align with ethical AI design standards.

# Compliance Manifest Exporter (static)
# OMNIPROOF ENHANCEMENT: Exports compliance manifests as signed PDFs for
# audits.
