class PluggyTeardownRaisedWarning(PluggyWarning):
#     A plugin raised an exception during an :ref:`old-style hookwrapper
#     <old_style_hookwrappers>` teardown.
#     Such exceptions are not handled by pluggy, and may cause subsequent
#     teardowns to be executed at unexpected times, or be skipped entirely.
#     This is an issue in the plugin implementation.
#     If the exception is unintended, fix the underlying cause.
#     If the exception is intended, switch to :ref:`new-style hook wrappers
#     <hookwrappers>`, or use :func:`result.force_exception()
#     <pluggy.Result.force_exception>` to set the exception instead of raising.
