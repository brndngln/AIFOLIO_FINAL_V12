#     Two content moderations models are available: `text-moderation-stable` and
#     `text-moderation-latest`.

#     The default is `text-moderation-latest` which will be automatically upgraded
#     over time. This ensures you are always using our most accurate model. If you use
#     `text-moderation-stable`, we will provide advanced notice before updating the
#     model. Accuracy of `text-moderation-stable` may be slightly lower than for
#     `text-moderation-latest`.
