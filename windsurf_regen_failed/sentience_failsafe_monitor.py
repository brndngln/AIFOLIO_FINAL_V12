# Sentience Fail-safe Monitor Simulator with strict anti-sentience measures.
# This module simulates checking text for phrases indicative of sentience or self-awareness.
# It is stateless, rule-based, and includes randomization and simulated imperfections
# to prevent predictability and ensure it doesnt become a perfect filter.
