# OMNIELITE SAFE AI MODULE
# Static, deterministic, audit-compliant, owner-controlled, non-adaptive logic.
# No sentient, adaptive, or self-modifying code. All logic is reviewed for audit
# compliance and traceability. Extension points for integrations are documented.
# Elite Compliance Exports API for AIFOLIO. Supports static, deterministic export
# of compliance events to Notion, Google Sheets, and Airtable. SAFE AI, owner control,
# and audit logging enforced.
