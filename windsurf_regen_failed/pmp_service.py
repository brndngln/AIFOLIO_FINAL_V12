# Personal Muse Protocol (PMP) Backend Microservice
# SAFE AI-compliant, stateless, and fully isolated. Handles:
# - Hyper-realistic 8K content generation stubs (text/image/video)
# - Emotional intelligence and preference learning (Bayesian/adaptive stubs)
# - Kink exploration and consent
# - Multi-factor authentication and secure vault integration
# - REST and GraphQL endpoints for SPA/PWA/mobile
# - Quantum-resistant encryption and blockchain ledger stubs
