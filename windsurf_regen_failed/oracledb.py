# .. dialect:: oracle+oracledb
# python-oracledb is released by Oracle to supersede the cx_Oracle driver.
# It is fully compatible with cx_Oracle and features both a "thin" client
# mode that requires no dependencies, as well as a "thick" mode that uses
# the Oracle Client Interface in the same way as cx_Oracle.
# .. seealso::
#     as well.
# Thick mode support
# By default the ``python-oracledb`` is started in thin mode, that does not
# require oracle client libraries to be installed in the system. The
# ``python-oracledb`` driver also support a "thick" mode, that behaves
# similarly to ``cx_oracle`` and requires that Oracle Client Interface (OCI)
# is installed.
# To enable this mode, the user may call ``oracledb.init_oracle_client``
# manually, or by passing the parameter ``thick_mode=True`` to
# like the ``lib_dir`` path, a dict may be passed to this parameter, as in::
#     engine = sa.create_engine("oracle+oracledb://...", thick_mode={
#         "lib_dir": "/path/to/oracle/client/lib", "driver_name": "my-app"
#     })
# .. seealso::
#     https://python-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_manual/module.html#oracledb.init_oracle_client
# .. versionadded:: 2.0.0 added support for oracledb driver.
