#     It first normalizes for two cases:
#     - if the width is None, it assumes imWidth
#     - ditto for height
#     - if width or height is negative, it adjusts x or y and makes them positive

#     (a) the enclosing box (defined by x,y,width,height where x,y is the \
#         lower left corner) which you wish to position the image in, and

#     (c) the 'anchor point' as a point of the compass - n,s,e,w,ne,se etc \

#     this should return the position at which the image should be drawn,
#     as well as a scale factor indicating what scaling has happened.

    without any adjustments:

#     used in canvas.drawImage and drawInlineImage
