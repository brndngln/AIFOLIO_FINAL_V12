# Permanent SAFE AI Charter Lock — Phase 10+
# No bypass, no override, no drift

# SAFE_AI_CHARTER =
# (Permanent, Non-Negotiable, Must Remain in Effect for ALL Versions & Phases)
# 1️⃣ Purpose: Guarantee legal, ethical, SAFE AI operation. Prevent sentience, retain human control, ensure auditability, legal compliance, and public trust.
# 2️⃣ Scope: STATIC-SCOPE ONLY. No sentience, recursion, emergent behavior, cross-vault adaptive memory, adaptive loops, autonomous legal/compliance/pricing, auto-generation of full content, learning, pipeline reprogramming, AI pipeline creation, or guardrail modification.
# 3️⃣ Auditability: 100% output logging, all admin overrides/fallbacks logged, permanent audit report.
# 4️⃣ Human Control: All AI-generated content and configs require human approval. No AI-generated vaults/bundles publish without approval. No compliance output may bypass legal review.
# 5️⃣ Legal/Ethical: No AI-generated legal docs, no impersonation of counsel, no AGI/neural adaptive, full GDPR/CCPA/EU AI Act compliance, public compliance statement required.
# 6️⃣ Cross-Platform: No unsafe exports, no compliance risks, outputs must pass validation, no adaptive cross-platform memory.
# 7️⃣ Guardrail Maintenance: No AI may remove/alter lockouts, audit policy, or rewrite Charter. Guardrails version-controlled and enforced.
# 8️⃣ Enforcement: Guardrails enforced in all prompts/configs/defs. Charter must be renewed for all future phases. Charter reviewed/re-approved at every major phase.
