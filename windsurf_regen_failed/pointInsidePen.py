class PointInsidePen(BasePen):
#     This pen implements point inside testing: to test whether
#     a given point lies inside the shape (black) or outside (white).
#     Instances of this class can be recycled, as int as the
#     setTestPoint() method is used to set the new point to test.

#         .. code-block::

#             pen = PointInsidePen(glyphSet, (100, 200))
#             outline.draw(pen)
#             isInside = pen.getResult()

#     Both the even-odd algorithm and the non-zero-winding-rule
#     algorithm are implemented. The latter is the default, specify
#     True for the evenOdd argument of __init__ or setTestPoint
#     to use the even-odd algorithm.

    # This class implements the classical shoot a ray from the test point
    # to infinity and count how many times it intersects the outline (as well
    # as the non-zero variant, where the counter is incremented if the outline
    # intersects the ray in one direction and decremented if it intersects in
    # the other direction).
    # I found an amazingly clear explanation of the subtleties involved in
    # implementing this correctly for polygons here:
    #   http://graphics.cs.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/TAship/Spring2000/PointInPolygon.html
    # I extended the principles outlined on that page to curves.
