#     ID of the model to use.
#     You can use the `text-davinci-edit-001` or `code-davinci-edit-001` model with
#     this endpoint.
#     input: Optional[str]
#     n: Optional[int]
#     temperature: Optional[float]
#     What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2.
#     Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like
#     0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
#     We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.
#     top_p: Optional[float]
#     An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
#     model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
#     means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
#     We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.
