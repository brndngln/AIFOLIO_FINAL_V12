# OMNIELITE Quantum Crypto Platform Status

- **Python version:** 3.11.x (detected)
- **pqcrypto:** Installed, but Kyber512 import failed (not available on macOS ARM64 via pip as of 2025-07)
- **Fallback:** Multi-key sharding (Shamir's SSS) is fully operational
- **Action:** For quantum log encryption, use a Linux x86_64 VM or Docker container for pqcrypto/Kyber512 support, or request an alternative (e.g. Open Quantum Safe liboqs)

## Recommendations
- Use `split_key`/`combine_key` for multi-party AES key recovery on all platforms
- Use SIEM/webhook for all ImportError/fallback events
- For full quantum, run log encryption on a supported Linux x86_64 host or VM
- HSM/airgap: use provided scripts for share export and immutable backup
