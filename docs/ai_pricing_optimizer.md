# AI Pricing Optimizer

AIFOLIOâ„¢ suggests dynamic price ranges for each product based on niche, competitor prices, refund risk, and sales history, with full audit logging and business-only logic.

## Features

- Dynamic price suggestion per product
- Considers niche, competitor prices, refund risk, and sales history
- Logs all suggestions in `/analytics/ai_pricing_optimizer_log.jsonl`
- Strictly non-sentient, deterministic logic

## Usage

```python
from autonomy.pipeline.ai_pricing_optimizer import suggest_price
price = suggest_price('Marketing', [29, 39, 49], 'low', [49, 49, 49])
print(price)
```

## Audit & Safety

- All price suggestions are logged for audit
- No sentient, learning, or autonomous logic is present
- All logic is deterministic and business-aligned
