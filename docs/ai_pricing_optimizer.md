# AI Pricing Optimizer

AIFOLIOâ„¢ suggests dynamic price ranges for each product based on niche, competitor prices, refund risk, and sales history, with full audit logging and business-only logic.

## Features

from autonomy.pipeline.ai_pricing_optimizer import suggest_price
price = suggest_price('Marketing', [29, 39, 49], 'low', [49, 49, 49])
print(price)
```
