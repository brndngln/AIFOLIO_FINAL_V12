# AI Re-Generation Confidence Meter

AIFOLIOâ„¢ assigns a confidence score to every AI output and blocks weak/problematic products from publishing.

## Features

- Confidence score for every AI output
- Considers consistency, grammar, uniqueness, legal/ethical risk
- Blocks weak or risky outputs from publishing
- Logs all scores and blocks in `/analytics/ai_regeneration_confidence_log.jsonl`
- Strictly non-sentient, deterministic logic

## Usage

```python
from autonomy.pipeline.ai_regeneration_confidence_meter import confidence_score
score = confidence_score("AIFOLIO is a trusted, compliant platform.")
print(score)
```

## Audit & Safety

- All outputs are scored before publishing
- Any blocked output requires human review
- All scores and blocks are logged for audit
- No sentient, learning, or autonomous logic is present
