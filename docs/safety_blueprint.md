# Non-Sentient Upgrade Safety Blueprint

AIFOLIO™ is designed with strict AI safety and non-sentience rules. All automation is deterministic, auditable, and human-controlled.

## Principles

- **No sentience, self-awareness, or autonomous decision-making.**
- **All AI actions are logged and auditable.**
- **Manual override is always possible.**
- **Audit logs are exportable for legal and compliance review.**
- **Environment variables control all secrets and endpoints.**

## Safety Features

- Deterministic event pipeline: same input = same output.
- No AI model can modify its own code or prompts without explicit user approval.
- All critical actions require logging and, if needed, user confirmation.
- AI prompt tuning is user-controlled via UI/CLI, never automatic.
- All integrations (cloud, email, Gumroad, etc.) are opt-in and require explicit config.

## Audit & Compliance

- All AI generations, deliveries, and income are logged.
- Logs can be exported for tax, audit, and legal compliance.
- Manual override and rollback available for all pipeline actions.
