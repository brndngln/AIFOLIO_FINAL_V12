# AI Prompt Tuning UI

AIFOLIOâ„¢ provides a secure, auditable, and non-sentient UI for editing and tuning AI prompts by niche or product type.

## Features

- Streamlit-based interactive UI
- Prompt preview window (deterministic, non-sentient)
- Anti-pattern detector (flags risky or non-compliant prompts)
- Language and spelling verification
- Prompt fingerprinting (unique hash for traceability)
- Full audit logging of every change (with before/after, fingerprint, user, timestamp)
- Human preview and approval required before publishing
- No learning, self-modification, or sentient logic

## Usage

1. **Start the UI:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run autonomy/pipeline/prompt_tuning_ui.py
   ```
2. **Edit or create a prompt:**
   - Select a prompt or create a new one
   - Edit the text, check for anti-patterns and spelling
   - Preview the AI output (stubbed, deterministic)
   - Save (requires human approval)
3. **Audit log:**
   - All changes are logged in `/analytics/prompt_audit_log.jsonl`
   - Fingerprints and before/after diffs included
   - Admins can review audit log in the UI

## Safety & Audit

- No prompt goes live without human approval
- All changes are logged and fingerprinted
- No sentient or autonomous logic is present
- All prompts are spell-checked and scanned for anti-patterns
