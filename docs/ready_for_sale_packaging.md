# Ready-for-Sale Packaging

AIFOLIOâ„¢ validates all files, generates a final checklist, and provides PDF visual previews before product release.

## Features
- Package integrity checker (validates all files)
- AI-generated final checklist per product
- PDF visual preview before release
- Logs all checks and checklists in `/analytics/ready_for_sale_packaging_log.jsonl`
- Strictly non-sentient, deterministic logic

## Usage

```python
from autonomy.pipeline.ready_for_sale_packaging import check_package_integrity, generate_final_checklist, pdf_visual_preview
files = ['sample.pdf', 'cover.jpg']
checklist = generate_final_checklist('prod_1', files)
preview = pdf_visual_preview('sample.pdf')
print(checklist)
print(preview)
```

## Audit & Safety
- All files are validated before release
- Human preview is required for every checklist
- All checks and previews are logged for audit
- No sentient, learning, or autonomous logic is present
