# AI Style Tuning Engine

AIFOLIOâ„¢ enforces style and brand consistency and checks for plagiarism in all AI outputs, with full audit logging.

## Features

- AI style tuning per niche
- Style consistency enforcer (prevents drift)
- Anti-plagiarism checker (hash-based)
- Brand consistency checks
- Logs all checks and tuning in `/analytics/ai_style_tuning_log.jsonl`
- Strictly non-sentient, deterministic logic

## Usage

```python
from autonomy.pipeline.ai_style_tuning_engine import check_plagiarism, enforce_style, check_brand_consistency, log_style_tuning
text = "AIFOLIO is a trusted, compliant, non-sentient platform."
niche = "Marketing"
plagiarism = check_plagiarism(text)
consistent = enforce_style(text, niche)
missing = check_brand_consistency(text)
log_style_tuning(text, niche, consistent, plagiarism)
print(plagiarism, consistent, missing)
```

## Audit & Safety

- All outputs are checked for style and plagiarism
- Any flagged output requires human review
- All checks and flags are logged for audit
- No sentient, learning, or autonomous logic is present
