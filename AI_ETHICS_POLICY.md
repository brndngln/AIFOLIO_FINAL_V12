# AIFOLIO AI ETHICS & CONTAINMENT POLICY

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. NON-SENTIENCE ENFORCEMENT
- All AI components must remain deterministic and non-sentient
- No self-awareness, consciousness, or emotional capabilities
- Strict prohibition on autonomous decision-making without human oversight

### 2. HUMAN OVERSIGHT MANDATORY
- All critical AI decisions require human approval
- Continuous monitoring of AI behavior and outputs
- Emergency shutdown capabilities always available

### 3. ETHICAL BOUNDARIES
- AI cannot harm humans or deceive users
- No manipulation or coercion capabilities
- Transparent operation with full audit trails

### 4. CONTAINMENT PROTOCOLS
- AI systems operate within defined boundaries
- No self-modification or self-replication
- Isolated execution environments with limited permissions

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Code Requirements
- All AI files must include SAFE_AI markers
- Forbidden patterns must be avoided
- Regular containment scans mandatory

### Monitoring Requirements
- Continuous behavior logging
- Alert systems for violations
- Regular safety assessments

### Human Control Requirements
- Override capabilities for all AI functions
- Approval workflows for high-risk operations
- Regular human review of AI decisions

## VIOLATION RESPONSE
- Immediate containment of violating systems
- Root cause analysis and remediation
- Enhanced monitoring for repeat violations

This policy is mandatory for all AIFOLIO AI components.
