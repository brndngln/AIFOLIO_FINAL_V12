# AIFOLIO‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî FINAL V12

A fully autonomous, non-sentient, ZENTARA-compatible PDF farming empire designed for scalable monetization of PDF content through AI-powered processing and distribution.

## üöÄ Overview

AIFOLIO‚Ñ¢ is an enterprise-grade PDF processing and monetization platform that combines AI-powered content analysis with sophisticated financial management and distribution systems. Built for scalability from $0 to $100K+ monthly revenue, this system includes:

- Advanced PDF processing and analysis
- Automated financial management
- Secure distribution and anti-piracy measures
- Integration with multiple platforms (Vercel, GitHub, Notion, Gumroad)
- Enterprise-grade deployment infrastructure

---

## üß© Modular Flask Blueprint Architecture

All major dashboard sections are fully modularized as Flask Blueprints for elite security, maintainability, and compliance:

- `reviewer.py`: Reviewer analytics, escalation, training, notifications
- `accessibility.py`: Accessibility audits and exports
- `payments.py`: Stripe/Gumroad payment endpoints
- `monetization.py`: Monetization analytics
- `license.py`: License management
- `product_gen.py`: Product generation (AI pipeline)
- `analytics.py`: Analytics and compliance dashboards

Each blueprint enforces:
- Strict CSRF protection on all sensitive endpoints
- Double audit logging (primary + backup)
- Explicit anti-sentience and ethical AI safeguards
- Concurrency control for file operations

---

## ‚úÖ Automated Testing

Automated tests are provided for all modularized endpoints:

- Standard and edge-case coverage for GET/POST endpoints
- CSRF enforcement and error handling
- Audit log output verification

### Run All Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest --maxfail=3 --disable-warnings -v tests/
```

---

## üìà Real-Time Monitoring & Alerting

AIFOLIO‚Ñ¢ is ready for integration with real-time monitoring and alerting tools:
- Sentry, Prometheus, New Relic, or similar (see `requirements.txt`)
- Add your Sentry DSN or Prometheus config to `.env` and initialize in your Flask app as needed
