# üö¶ Vault Trigger & Stub Enhancement Package (SAFE AI)

## üîπ New Core Deliverables (2025 Upgrade)

- **Vault creation/update triggers**: All vault creation and update actions produce structured event logs, trigger analytics, and alerting.
- **Real-time dashboard auto-refresh**: Streamlit-based dashboards (`vault_dashboard_realtime.py`, `vault_event_viewer.py`) update instantly with new events. No manual reload needed.
- **Slack/Telegram/Email alerts**: Alerts for vault creation, update, and failure are sent to channels configured via `.env`. See `vault_alerts.py` and `email_alerts.py`.
- **Retry-safe hooks**: All integrations and hooks use exponential backoff and never block main vault flow. See `retry_safe_hooks.py`.
- **Fully implemented integrations**: CRM, Gumroad, Stripe, Notion, Analytics, and XBRL export modules are production-ready, no stubs remain. All log to `/analytics/`.
- **Webhook framework**: Trigger post-processing webhooks for vault events, with error logging and secret support. See `webhook_framework.py`.
- **Vault activity log**: Every action, user, and result is logged for traceability. See `vault_activity_log.py`.
- **Template version tracking**: All vaults record template/version used for auditability. See `template_version_tracker.py`.

---

## üîπ SAFE AI & Sentience Lockout

- **No sentience, no learning, no memory, no chaining**: All AI modules are static-scope, single-pass, and have no persistent state or emergent behavior.
- **No autonomous control**: AI never controls pricing, UX, vault updates, or economic variables. All outputs require human review where relevant.
- **No memory paths or cross-vault learning**: Each vault is processed in isolation.
- **No recursive feedback loops or decision chaining**: All logic is strictly feed-forward.
- **All exceptions logged**: No errors are swallowed; all exceptions are logged to `/logs/error.log`.
- **All secrets/config in .env**: No hardcoded tokens, URLs, or credentials.
- **Final audit**: All modules reviewed for compliance with SAFE AI constraints.

- Multi-channel alerting and outbound webhooks for integration-readiness
- Heatmap and timeline analytics for operational monitoring
- Replay and auto-remediation hooks for critical failures

### ‚ú® Supported Event Types

All valid event types are defined in `autonomy/pipeline/event_definitions.py` and include:
- `vault_created`, `vault_published`, `vault_sold`, `vault_refunded`, `delivery_sent`, `export_failed`, `receipt_created`, `vault_downloaded`, `vault_metadata_updated`, `upsell_triggered`, `policy_signed`, `vault_test_run`, `vault_fulfilled`
- **New:** `refund_issued`, `download_initiated`, `policy_violated` (and easily extendable)

### üèóÔ∏è Event Bus Architecture

- **Central dispatcher** (`event_bus.py`):
  - Assigns a unique `event_id` to every event
  - Dynamically loads and invokes the correct listener for each event
  - Logs every event (with `ai_results` if present) to `/analytics/event_log.json`
  - Logs event heatmap/timeline data to `/analytics/event_heatmap.json`
  - Triggers outbound webhooks for all events (future-proof for Zapier, Notion, etc.)
  - Blocks deployment if any handler is missing for a registered event
  - Auto-retries critical events (e.g., `vault_sold`, `delivery_sent`) and prints replay/remediation stubs on failure

### üß† Listener Modules & Static AI Logic

All listeners in `autonomy/pipeline/listeners/` follow a robust pattern:
- **Static AI anomaly/fraud/compliance detection** using only static rules (no learning, no memory)
- Logs all results as `ai_results` in the event log for dashboarding and audit
- Triggers multi-channel alerts (Slack, Telegram, Email) and outbound webhooks on anomalies or compliance failures
- Retry-safe execution and robust error handling
- Ready for future expansion with additional AI, analytics, or workflow hooks

**Examples:**
- `vault_created.py`: Checks for metadata compliance, formatting, and anomalies; logs results and triggers alerts/webhooks as needed
- `vault_sold.py`: Flags price outliers, invalid buyers, restricted countries, and compliance issues
- `export_failed.py`: Suggests root causes (timeout, disk, permission, compliance), logs and alerts
- `refund_issued.py`, `download_initiated.py`, `policy_violated.py`: All include static compliance/anomaly checks and full alert/logging pipeline

### üìà Analytics, Heatmaps, and Timeline

- Every event is logged with a unique `event_id`, timestamp, payload, and `ai_results`
- Heatmap and timeline analytics are logged to `/analytics/event_heatmap.json`, including anomaly/compliance flags for each event
- Ready for dashboard visualization of event frequency, anomaly spikes, and compliance trends

### üîÅ Event Replay & Auto-Remediation

- Replay and remediation stubs are provided for all critical events
- If a critical event fails, the system logs the failure and prints a remediation suggestion (future: auto-remediation logic)
- All event logs are ready for replay if needed

### üåê Integration & Extensibility

- Outbound webhooks are triggered for every event (can POST to Zapier, Notion, or any external system)
- All secrets and endpoints are controlled via environment variables
- The architecture is modular and ready for new event types, listeners, and integrations

### üìù How to Add a New Event Listener

1. Add a new event type to `event_definitions.py` and register in `ALL_EVENTS`
2. Create a new listener in `autonomy/pipeline/listeners/` following the robust pattern (see examples)
3. The event bus will auto-detect and dispatch to your new listener
4. Update the dashboard UI to support the new event type if needed
