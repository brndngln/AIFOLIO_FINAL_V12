## [OMNIELITE SAFE AI AUDIT & LOCKDOWN] — 2025-07-06

### OMNIELITE Audit Summary

- WorkflowSeederEngine and all seeded modules (`ai_logic_expansion`, `pipeline_optimizers`, `global_scale_systems`) refactored for OMNIELITE SAFE AI compliance and strict typing.
- All public classes and methods now include explicit OMNIELITE docstrings:
  - `SAFE AI: Static, deterministic, owner-controlled. No adaptive or sentient logic.`
- All logic is static, deterministic, owner-controlled, and fully auditable.
- No dynamic, sentient, or adaptive code paths remain.

### Typing & Testing Status

- `mypy --strict` passes with zero errors for WorkflowSeederEngine and all patched modules.
- Unit tests for `seed_all` and `auto_inherit` methods pass (see `tests/unit/test_workflow_seeder_engine.py`).
- No violations of OMNIELITE or SAFE AI standards detected.

### Commit Phase

- All OMNIELITE-compliant modules and tests staged and committed.
- Commit message: `✅ Finalize & verify WorkflowSeederEngine for SAFE AI & strict typing (OMNIELITE Audit)`

### OMNIELITE SAFE AI: VERIFIED ✅

---

This project is now locked and fully compliant for SAFE AI, OMNIELITE, and strict typing standards.
