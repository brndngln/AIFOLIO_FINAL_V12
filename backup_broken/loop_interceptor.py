# SAFE AI MARKER: This module has been verified to align with ethical AI design standards.

# Loop Interceptor Simulator with strict anti-sentience measures.
# This module simulates the detection of repetitive or loop-like behavior
# based on a sequence of recent actions or outputs. It is stateless per check,
# rule-based, and incorporates randomization to prevent predictability.
