#     Applies billionaire filter, ROI, and priority logic to reinvestment proposals.
#     Provides static, SAFE AI-compliant ranking and filtering for reinvestment logic.

#         Filters and ranks reinvestment proposals based on ROI, saturation, and billionaire logic.

#             proposals: List of proposal dicts with 'roi', 'saturated', 'growth', and 'cost'.
#             brain_profiles: List of billionaire brain profile dicts (unused in logic, but required for interface).
#         Returns:
#             List of filtered and ranked proposal dicts.
