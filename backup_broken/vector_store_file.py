#     object: Literal["vector_store.file"]

#     status: Literal["in_progress", "completed", "cancelled", "failed"]

#     The status of the vector store file, which can be either `in_progress`,
#     `completed`, `cancelled`, or `failed`. The status `completed` indicates that the
#     vector store file is ready for use.

#     usage_bytes: int
#     The total vector store usage in bytes.

#     Note that this may be different from the original file size.

#     vector_store_id: str

#     The ID of the

#     that the [File](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files) is

#     attributes: Optional[Dict[str, Union[str, float, bool]]] = None
#     Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object.

#     This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a
