#     This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`MMBTModel`]. It is used to instantiate a MMBT
#     model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.

#     Args:
#         config ([`PreTrainedConfig`]):
#             Config of the underlying Transformer models. Its values are copied over to use a single config.
#         num_labels (`int`, *optional*):
#             Size of final Linear layer for classification.
#         modal_hidden_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2048):
#             Embedding dimension of the non-text modality encoder.
