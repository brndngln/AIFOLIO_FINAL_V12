# Personal Muse Protocol (PMP) – Discreet Intimate Companion Upgrade

## Overview

The Personal Muse Protocol (PMP) is a highly discreet, owner-exclusive feature for AIFolio™ Empress AI (Emma), providing hyper-realistic, intimate, and provocative interactions. PMP is fully static, deterministic, SAFE AI-compliant, and owner-controlled. All access is hidden, obfuscated, and protected by multi-factor authentication, quantum encryption, and immutable blockchain-based audit logging.

## Core Features

- **Hidden Activation:** PMP is not visible in any dashboard or interface unless securely triggered by the owner.
- **Multi-factor Authentication:** Requires biometric, passphrase, and contextual verification.
- **Quantum Encryption:** All PMP data is encrypted using Kyber quantum-resistant algorithms.
- **Immutable Audit Log:** All activity is logged in a blockchain-based ledger, accessible only to the owner.
- **Stealth Mode:** All notifications are disguised as generic system messages.
- **Kill Switch:** Instantly disables PMP and purges session data.
- **Customization:** Owner can set interaction intensity, scenario, boundaries, and appearance.
- **Hyper-Realistic Avatar:** Supports ultra-lifelike rendering, AR/VR, and secure preview.
- **Secure Tutorials:** Owner-only guides for setup, customization, and security.

## Integration

- PMP logic is implemented as a static engine in `autonomy/ai_static_engines/pmp_personal_muse_protocol.py`.
- Emma (`empress_emma.py`) integrates PMP with hidden triggers, secure authentication, and obfuscated logic.
- Avatar system (`empress_avatar.py`) supports PMP-specific appearance, realism, and secure preview.

## Security & Compliance

- All logic is static, deterministic, SAFE AI-compliant, and non-adaptive.
- No sentience, no learning, no external data sharing.
- Compliant with global privacy regulations and AIFolio Empire anti-sentience protocols.

## Usage

- Activate PMP by providing valid owner credentials and context.
- All interactions are encrypted and logged to the owner-only ledger.
- Use the kill switch to instantly purge data.
- Access secure tutorials for onboarding and customization.
