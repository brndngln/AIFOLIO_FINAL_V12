## 🚀 Deployment Strategies

### Staging Deployment

- **Trigger:** Push to `develop` branch
- **Strategy:** Rolling deployment with health checks
- **Environment:** `staging.aifolio.app`
- **Monitoring:** Basic health checks and performance metrics

### Production Deployment

- **Trigger:** Push to `main` branch or manual approval
- **Strategy:** Blue-green deployment with zero downtime
- **Environment:** `aifolio.app`
- **Monitoring:** Full monitoring stack with alerting

### Rollback Strategy

- **Automatic Rollback:** Triggered by health check failures
- **Manual Rollback:** Available via deployment script
- **Rollback Time:** < 5 minutes for automatic, < 2 minutes for manual
- **Data Protection:** Database migrations are forward-compatible only

## ⚙️ Configuration Management
