# EmmaLogs

This file marks the successful completion of the Emma Governor full integration chain.

- All agent spawners and vault managers are patched to require Emma Governor registration, fingerprint checks, and auto-kill for unregistered agents.
- Immutable audit trails should be written to this directory or file as needed for compliance.
- If you want to store full logs, ensure this path is not ignored by .gitignore or update your logging configuration accordingly.
