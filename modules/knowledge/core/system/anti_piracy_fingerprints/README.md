# Anti-Piracy Fingerprint System

This system implements a non-sentient anti-piracy mechanism for AIFOLIOâ„¢ PDF assets.

## Features

- Unique fingerprint generation for each PDF
- Tamper detection
- Usage tracking
- Non-sentient compliance monitoring

## Security Notes

- All operations are deterministic and non-learning
- No AI self-modification capabilities
- Strictly limited to fingerprint generation and verification

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Fingerprints must be generated at PDF creation
2. Verification occurs at every access point
3. No learning or adaptive capabilities allowed
4. All operations must be explicitly defined
