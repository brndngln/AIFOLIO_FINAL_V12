# AIFOLIO Autonomy & SAFE AI Pipeline

This directory contains all SAFE AI pipeline modules, event listeners, admin tools, and compliance/security engines. All modules are:

- Static-scope, non-sentient, no recursion
- Manual-only for all admin actions
- All outputs and errors are logged for audit
- No skipped alerts for any critical or compliance flows
- No AI ever controls pricing, vault updates, or user-facing content without explicit human review

See the SAFE AI Master Checklist and audit report in `analytics/` for compliance documentation.
