# AIFOLIO™ Frontend/Backend SAFE AI Integration Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to connect all SAFE AI modules (analytics, compliance, email, legal, filename sanitation) into a fully integrated frontend + backend system with live dashboards and admin tools.

---

## 1️⃣ Connect Dashboard Components to Backend Data Endpoints
- Wire the React dashboard (see `frontend_dashboard_stub.js`) to backend analytics endpoints:
  - Revenue, Top Vaults: `/api/analytics/revenue`, `/api/analytics/top_vaults`
  - Buyer Segments: `/api/analytics/buyer_segments`
  - Compliance: `/api/analytics/compliance_stats`
  - Vault Performance Trends: `/api/analytics/vault_performance`, `/api/analytics/vault_trends`
  - Multi-vault Comparison: `/api/analytics/multi_vault_comparison`
  - Segment Reporting: `/api/analytics/segment_report`
- Use fetch/AJAX in your React components to retrieve and display these stats.

## 2️⃣ Link PDF/Email Exports to Admin UI
- Connect export buttons to endpoints that trigger PDF/email exports:
  - Revenue PDF: `/api/analytics/export/revenue_pdf`
  - Compliance Report: `/api/analytics/export/compliance_pdf`
  - Buyer Segment Export: `/api/analytics/export/buyer_segments`
- Backend should call the relevant Python modules (e.g., `revenue_report_export.py`) and log all exports.

## 3️⃣ Hook Compliance Trackers to Vault Publish Flow
- On vault publish, call compliance trackers (e.g., `compliance_tracker.py`, `static_compliance_checks.py`).
- Block publish if compliance fails, or flag for admin review.
- Log all compliance checks and admin overrides.

## 4️⃣ Add Legal + Receipt Attachment Controls to Vault Checkout
- Ensure legal policy confirmation and receipt delivery are enforced in the checkout flow.
- Use compliance stats to display confirmation rates in the dashboard.
- Log all confirmations and deliveries for audit.

## 5️⃣ General Integration Notes
- All actions (exports, admin triggers, compliance checks) must be logged for audit.
- No adaptive dashboards or marketing triggers.
- All analytics are static, deterministic, and aggregate only.
- Follow GDPR/CCPA opt-out and privacy compliance strictly.
