# OMNIMAP: OMNIELITE AIFOLIO™ Vault Intelligence System

**Version:** OMNIELITE / Final Integration Audit — 2025-06-30

## Overview
AIFOLIO™ OMNIELITE is a fully unified, production-ready, SAFE AI-compliant digital content empire platform. This system integrates 7 elite vaults with modular AI, dynamic dashboards, analytics, and robust export/safety logic. All logic is static, deterministic, owner-controlled, and non-sentient by design.

## Core Modules (core/)
- `ai_engine.js`: Unified logic routing, token limits, override logic
- `prompt_executor.js`: Vault-specific prompt execution pipeline
- `style_tuner.js`: Style adaptation (spiritual, clinical, mystical, etc.)
- `scheduler.js`: Content drop automation
- `pdf_builder.js`: Vault-aware PDF export
- `image_generator.js`: Vault-aware image generation

---

## UI Engine (dashboard/)
- `vault_selector.vue`: Loads vaults from config/vault_registry.json
- `vault_ui/`: One .vue per vault (dynamic rendering, analytics, export, theme)
- Theme: Neon-glass, dark, rounded 2xl, hover animations, vault icons

---

## Branding (branding/)
- `/logos/`: Main and alternate platform logos
- `/vault_icons/`: Per-vault icons (SVG/PNG)
- `font_config.js`: Centralized font config for all UI

---

## Prompt Sets (config/prompt_sets/)
- One JSON per vault (e.g., templiq_templates.json)
- Each contains prompt templates, metadata, and style/tone controls

---

## Safety & Compliance
- Non-sentient, static SAFE AI guardrails
- Token limits, reflective prompt block, personal data block
- Vault-specific tone controls (esp. THERAPIQ, RITUALUX)
- Full audit trail and owner override at every step

---

## Analytics & Export
- Analytics: Drops, prompt usage, download rates, leaderboard
- Export: PDF, PNG, ZIP, license key per vault
- Gumroad/Stripe export prep (stubbed for security)

---

## Deployment & Testing
- All vaults are live, selectable, and modular
- Hot-reloading ready (Vite + Vitest)
- Linting, build, and test scripts provided in frontend/package.json
