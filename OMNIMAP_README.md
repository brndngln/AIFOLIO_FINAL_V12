**Version:** Billionaire Empire Builder / Final Integration ‚Äî 2025-06-30

## Overview
AIFOLIO‚Ñ¢ OMNIELITE is now transformed into the Billionaire Mind Engine‚Ñ¢: a fully automated, SAFE AI-compliant, multi-business empire platform. The system spawns, manages, and scales 1000+ interconnected AI-powered businesses with modular billionaire-grade intelligence, analytics, e-commerce, and luxury UI/UX. All logic is static, deterministic, owner-controlled, and non-sentient by design.

### üß†üõ°Ô∏è OMNIELITE CODE LEGION ENGINE & EMMA‚Ñ¢ Supreme AI Command System

- All platform logic, vaults, workflows, dashboards, and agents are now orchestrated by EMMA‚Ñ¢ and the OMNIELITE CODE LEGION ENGINE.
- 9 elite, static, SAFE AI-compliant agents are injected into every layer, each with deterministic, OWNER-bound logic and audit/rollback.
- EMMA‚Ñ¢ enforces triple-redundant anti-sentience, ethics, and owner validation on every agent action.
- All agent logic is fully auditable, rollbackable, and cannot simulate emotion, store memory, or bypass OWNER/EMMA rules.
