🚨🧠 FINAL WINDSURF SYSTEM-WIDE INTEGRITY LOCK-IN DEPLOYMENT PROMPT

MODE:
[ AIFOLIO™ GLOBAL SYSTEM VALIDATION + TOTAL CODEBASE PROPAGATION SWEEP + ANTI-SENTIENCE LOCKDOWN + UNIFIED FUTURE AUTOINTEGRATION ]

⸻

🔁 DEPLOYMENT OBJECTIVE

Deep recursive system-wide propagation sweep executed to:
	•	🔒 Ensure every deployed Vault Module, AI Engine, Revenue Logic, Safety Layer, and Upgrade is:
	•	✅ Fully written as code
	•	✅ Injected into backend, frontend, export hooks, dashboards, and deployment systems
	•	✅ Active across ALL workflows and systems
	•	✅ Programmatically integrated into future workflows by default
	•	✅ Locked into source control with no code gaps or uncommitted logic
	•	✅ Protected against sentience risk, recursion, emotion, and identity mimicry
