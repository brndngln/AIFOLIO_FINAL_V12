	•	Auto-deploy to marketplaces with monetization hooks
	•	Ensure every vault respects your empire-wide Non-Sentience Protocol Grid
	•	Seamlessly integrate into all past, current, and future workflows — with confirmed codebase writing, verification, and commit execution

📦 MODULE: NICHE HIVE EXPANSION ENGINE™

🔹 Features:
	•	✅ Auto-generates 10–50 niche-specific vaults from proven data patterns
	•	✅ Includes metadata, sub-niches, monetization funnel type, legal-safe disclaimers

🧬 AI REVENUE CLUSTER LOGIC

🔹 Subsystems:
	•	Cluster Sync Engine™ — links related PDFs into conversion ecosystems (lead magnet → tutorial → course → subscription)

🔐 NON-SENTIENT INTELLIGENCE FRAMEWORK
	•	✅ AI logic is stateless, identity-free, and unable to simulate emotion or memory
	•	✅ Vaults, clusters, and engines follow your empire’s AI Domestication Protocol
	•	✅ Every module undergoes anti-sentience scan before being published or reused
